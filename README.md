# Arduino DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor with LEDs

This Arduino project uses the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to measure the ambient temperature and humidity in a room, and displays the values on a set of LEDs.

## Hardware

- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- 3x LEDs (one each for temperature, humidity, and status)
- 220Î© resistors (3x)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Sketch

The sketch reads the temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor and displays them on the temperature and humidity LEDs, respectively. The status LED is used to indicate whether the sensor is functioning properly or not.
